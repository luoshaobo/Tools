/**
 * \brief PayloadInterface provides functions necessery for SignalFactory to
 *        encode/decode a payload using a CodecInterface impelementations. Typically
 *        to be used as content in a CCM.
 *
 *        A typical realization will support either encode or decode for one codec,
 *        in such cases either GetPayload or SetPayload should always return false.
 *
 *        Content which is received from the outside should only be decodable
 *        and content which is sent should only be encodable, this to avoid dead code
 *        in the prodcution system.
 *
 *        Cases may exist where both encode and decodae shall be supported, or several
 *        codecs.
 *
 *        Payload realizations may be as complex as they like and contain deeply nested
 *        structures, as long as they are able to pack/unpack everything into/from a
 *        format the codec understands. The intent however is to use nested PayloadInterface
 *        realizations in such cases, see for instance CcmSignal.
 *
 *        For normal cases a abstract utility base class realizing PayloadInterface and
 *        exposing a reduced interface will exist for each codec supported by the system.
 *        Deriving from these is the recommended way to implement a payload.
